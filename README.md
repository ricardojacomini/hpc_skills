üß≠ Perspective & Professional Insight
üß† "In my opinion, there are two distinct paths in High-performance computing (HPC): one leaning toward system administration, and the other toward scientific software engineering."

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing Note

**Important:** This matrix is intended for professionals who will be engaged in tasks related to on-premise HPC initiatives for the University's facility. For those involving Microsoft Azure Cloud, I recommend taking the **[Azure AZ-104 certification: The Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification)**.

The system administration path emphasizes foundational skills in Linux, networking, and hardware management (CPU, GPU, FPGA). The scientific software path leans into coding, algorithms, and specialized HPC frameworks and tools.
Having worked as a Scientific Software Engineer for several years, I designed this matrix using Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy to reflect the skill progression I‚Äôve observed and experienced firsthand. It integrates over 25 years of deep technical involvement in Linux, networking, and hands-on coding, as well as the advanced tools and workflows I utilized across roles.
This framework is intended to help others:
- üß© Identify which skills they currently have and at what level
- üîç Choose where to invest learning time based on interest or career goals
- üìà Advance from foundational (Level 1) to expert-level mastery (Level 6)

For example:
- Skills like Linux and Python often provide a solid foundation for HPC System Engineering.
- Specialized technologies and frameworks mark progression into Scientific Software Engineering.
The more skills you master and elevate toward higher cognitive levels ‚Äî especially those aligned toward the right columns of the matrix ‚Äî the deeper your expertise and seniority in HPC becomes.

## üìä Visual Matrix

For a comprehensive visual representation of the HPC skills matrix based on Bloom's Taxonomy, please refer to:

**[üìÑ HPC Skills Matrix (PDF)](./matrix-bloom_taxonomy.pdf)**

This PDF provides a detailed matrix mapping HPC technologies and skills across cognitive levels and skill progression paths, based on my [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-s-jacomini/) when I worked at The Advanced Research Computing at Hopkins (ARCH) HPC facilities, 2021-2025.

# üí° HPC Self-Evaluation Matrix: Knowledge & Responsibility Levels

This repository provides a structured overview of technical competencies and cognitive development across High Performance Computing (HPC) domains. Based on Bloom's Taxonomy, it helps assess skill levels for HPC professionals and guide learning paths.
